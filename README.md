So this is an assignment for the role of Android Developer Intern at Vecros.

This includes the usage of exoplayer for playing the video, rtsp for the real time streaming(supports only rtsp), for some reason the video buffers at first so make sure you have a fast and stable network.

Challenges faced - Implementing the RTSP. I have 0 experience with video playing so I used stackoverflow and gemini for some guidance. Went through multiple videos on youtube for a better overview
